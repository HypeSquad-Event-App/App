Don't have the time to appropiatly describe the differents endpoints of the api, will do it later in the week.

A gif of this thing in work is available on the discord, pinned in the #ressources channel, but basically it's an API server with endpoints to add, list and delete the events. 

- addEvent.html - to add an event, using google's information
- map.html - to see the events

don't worry about my api key being public here, it can't be used against me.
